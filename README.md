# dDBEdit
A quickly written CLI tool to help artists add objects to Happy Flower. The code isn't particularly pretty.

# Requirements
This assumes that https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2 is present (the main .cpp and .h file) in the same directory as main.cpp.

# Usage
Place in the root of your client's /res/ folder, along with a file called lastIds.txt next to it. 
Then click and run, follow instructions inside of the app.
